<u><b>Introduction:</b></u><br>
> Blackjack is a simple card game made popular by casinos.<br>
> The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.<br>
> The value of a player's hand is the sum of the points of all the cards in the player's hand.<br>
> This means that the person with points closest to but not above 21 wins the game.<br>

<u><b>Points:</b></u><br>
> Each face card(i.e. K, Q and J) is of 10 points each.<br>
> All other cards execpt Ace are worth their numeric value itself.<br>
> An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points according to the player's wish.<br>
> In this specific program, the computer automaticaly chooses the best value for an Ace.<br>
  
<u><b>Gameplay:</b></u><br>
> Each player is dealt 2 cards at the beginning.<br>
> The player can then 'HIT' or 'STAND'.<br>
> To hit, means to ask the dealer for another card.<br>
> To stand, means to ask for no more cards and end your turn.<br>
> A 'BUST' happens if the points of a player exceeds 21.<br>
> A 'BUSTED' player immediately looses the game.<br>

<u><b>Blackjack:</b></u><br>
> A 'BLACKJACK' is a combination of 2 cards that perfectly adds upto 21 i.e. one card of<br> 
  ten points and an Ace.<br>
> The player with a blackjack immediatley wins the game.<br><br>
